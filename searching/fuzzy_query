#Fuzzy matches is a way to tolerate certain level of typos


# Type of typos can be
1. Substitution - replacing comman typo chars. for e.g. Rocket and Rockat 
2. Insertion - Unnecessary extra chars. for e.g. Assertion and Asserrtion
3. Deletion - ex. Intersteller and Intersteler
All of above have an "edit distance" of 1 as there is a typo with one char. 
"edit distance" is coming from "levenshtein edit distance" and (i have no idea about it.). Read it here https://dzone.com/articles/the-levenshtein-algorithm-1




Example Fuzzy query in Elastic Search
{
    "query":{
        "fuzzy":{
            "title":{"value":"Intrsteller","fuzziness":2}
            }
    }
}
