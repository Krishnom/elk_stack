#Used to find exact items in order

curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" -XGET localhost:9200/movies/_search?pretty -d '
{
    "query": {
        "match_phrase":{
                "title":"star wars"
        }
    }
}'

#Proximity query
It gives you ability to search phrase that are in order but some words in between is also valid
For e.g. Below query will return all docs with title ".*star wars.*"
{
    "query": {
        "match_phrase":{
                "title":"star wars"
        }
    }
}

But below Proximity extends it to ".*star.*wars.*" 
{
    "query": {
        "match_phrase":{
                "title":{"query":"star beyond", "slop": 100}
        }
    }
}
