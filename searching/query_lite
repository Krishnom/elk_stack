Query Lite/URL search/ Curl Test

# to search a movie with matching title "star"
/movies/_search?q=title:star

#to get movies with title having "star" and released after 2010
/movies/_search?q=+year>2010+title:star

Pros of using "Query Lite"
    Easy to write
    Shorthand and thus no messy json
    with curl works perfect if whole query is enclosed in double quotes
Cons
    Not browser friendly. You need to URL encode all special chars

    With URL encoding, It can be very cryptic. for e.g. for second query wuth URL encoded query will be 
        /movies/_search?q=%2Byear%3A%3E2010+%2Btitle%3Astar
